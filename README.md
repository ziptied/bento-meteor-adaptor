## Features

* **Native Meteor Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Meteor's built-in email system
* **Account Email Support**: Works with Meteor's account verification and password reset emails
* **Simple Configuration**: Easy setup with environment variables or Meteor settings
* **Type Safety**: Includes TypeScript definitions for all configurations and options

## Requirements

- Meteor 3.1.1+
- meteor-email 3.1.1+
- Bento API Keys

## Getting started

### Installation

Install the package via Meteor:

```bash
meteor add bento:meteor-mail
```

### Configuration

You can configure the package in three ways:

1. Using environment variables:

```bash
BENTO_SITE_UUID=your_site_uuid
BENTO_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
BENTO_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

2. Using Meteor settings (`settings.json`):

```json
{
  "private": {
    "bento": {
      "siteUuid": "your_site_uuid",
      "publishableKey": "your_publishable_key",
      "secretKey": "your_secret_key"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Server setup in your main entry point:

```typescript
import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
import { Accounts } from 'meteor/accounts-base';

Meteor.startup(() => {
  Accounts.emailTemplates.from = 'your-email@domain.com';
  Accounts.emailTemplates.siteName = 'Your Site Name';

  Accounts.emailTemplates.verifyEmail = {
    subject() {
      return 'Verify your email address';
    },
    text(user, url) {
      return `Hello ${user.profile?.name || 'there'}!\n\n`
        + 'To verify your email address, simply click the link below:\n\n'
        + url;
    }
  };
});
```

## Usage

Once configured, use Meteor's standard email functionality to send emails through Bento:

```typescript
import { Email } from 'meteor/email';

Email.send({
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  from: 'sender@yourdomain.com',
  subject: 'Hello',
  text: 'This is a test email sent through Bento!'
});
```

## Things to Know

1. The sender email address (`from`) MUST be configured as an author in your Bento account
2. Bento does not support `no-reply` sender addresses
3. The package will throw a `Meteor.Error` with code 'email-failed' if there are sending issues
4. For older Meteor versions, you may try editing `api.versionsFrom('3.1.1')` in `package.js`, but this is untested
5. For more advanced usage, refer to the [Bento API Documentation](https://docs.bentonow.com)
